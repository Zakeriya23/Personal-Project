            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Zakeriya Muhumed, a passionate and driven
              Computer Science student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science
              at Portland State University, expecting to graduate in Spring
              2025. I have a strong background in software development, cloud
              computing, and decentralized systems, with a keen interest in
              innovative technologies that solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at Amazon
              Web Services (AWS) for 12 weeks, during which I achieved three
              major certifications: AWS Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect
              Associate (SAA), and Developer. These certifications are not just
              milestones—they reflect the learning, dedication, and growth I
              experienced at AWS. My time there allowed me to deepen my
              understanding of cloud architecture and developer tools while
              working alongside inspiring mentors and colleagues.
            </p>
            <p>
              My professional experience also includes working as a Software
              Engineer Intern at Code PDX, where I contributed to the
              development of a decentralized document storage application for
              housing-insecure individuals using React, JavaScript, and Solid.
              Additionally, as a Research Assistant at Portland State
              University, I collaborated on a National Science
              Foundation-supported project to enhance software for microorganism
              tracking with the ELVIS microscope aboard the ISS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond internships and research, I bring strong skills in
              communication, teamwork, and problem-solving from my professional
              experience in security operations. My technical expertise spans
              programming languages such as C/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, and
              tools like AWS, Git, and Visual Studio.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am deeply grateful for the opportunities I’ve had and the
              mentors who’ve guided me. With a solid foundation built through
              education and hands-on experience, I am excited about the future
              and eager to continue growing, learning, and contributing to
              meaningful projects.

              Discom is a web application developed using the MERN stack
              (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that emulates core
              functionalities of Discord. The frontend is built with React and
              Axios, providing a responsive user interface for real-time
              communication. The backend, powered by Express and MongoDB,
              manages user authentication and message handling. This project
              demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development and real-time
              data processing.

              ><br />
              The Finance Tracking App is a Python-based application designed to
              help users manage personal expenses and budgets. It includes
              features for tracking income, expenses, and savings, providing
              insights into financial habits. The app utilizes AWS RDS and MySQL
              for efficient data management and employs data visualization
              libraries like Matplotlib to create insightful graphs and charts
              for financial analysis. This project strengthened my skills in
              Python programming, data management, and visualization.
