            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Zakeriya Muhumed, a passionate and driven
              Computer Science student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science
              at Portland State University, expecting to graduate in Spring 2025.
              I have a strong background in software development, cloud
              computing, and decentralized systems, with a keen interest in
              innovative technologies that solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to intern at Amazon
              Web Services (AWS) for 12 weeks, during which I achieved three
              major certifications: AWS Cloud Practitioner, Solutions Architect
              Associate (SAA), and Developer. These certifications are not just
              milestones‚Äîthey reflect the learning, dedication, and growth I
              experienced at AWS. My time there allowed me to deepen my
              understanding of cloud architecture and developer tools while
              working alongside inspiring mentors and colleagues.
            </p>
            <p>
              My professional experience also includes working as a Software
              Engineer Intern at Code PDX, where I contributed to the
              development of a decentralized document storage application for
              housing-insecure individuals using React, JavaScript, and Solid.
              Additionally, as a Research Assistant at Portland State
              University, I collaborated on a National Science
              Foundation-supported project to enhance software for microorganism
              tracking with the ELVIS microscope aboard the ISS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond internships and research, I bring strong skills in
              communication, teamwork, and problem-solving from my professional
              experience in security operations. My technical expertise spans
              programming languages such as C/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, and
              tools like AWS, Git, and Visual Studio.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am deeply grateful for the opportunities I‚Äôve had and the
              mentors who‚Äôve guided me. With a solid foundation built through
              education and hands-on experience, I am excited about the future
              and eager to continue growing, learning, and contributing to
              meaningful projects.
            </p>
